## PreProcessing    
We're collecting a public dataset from Kaggle. Kaggle is a wonderful resource for public
datasets, with a large selection of datasets on a number of topics.  
Then we are identifying types of attributes of data, removing dulicate rows, removing null attributes valued rows and removing outliers for data consistency and data cleaning.
